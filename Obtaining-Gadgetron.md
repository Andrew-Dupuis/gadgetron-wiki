The Gadgetron is made available as a cross-platform source code distribution, which compiles and has been tested to run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows 7. Compilation instructions for each platform are available in the "Compiling and Installing the Gadgetron" section of the Wiki.

Generally speaking, the Gadgetron is easiest set up on Linux since all dependencies are readily available. If you want to get started quickly with the Gadgetron and happen to not be using Linux, it is easy to install Ubuntu (our preferred Linux distribution) in a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox, <https://www.virtualbox.org/>) and follow the Linux installation instructions [here](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/wiki/Linux-Installation).
