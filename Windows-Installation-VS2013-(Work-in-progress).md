The following is a list of steps we have used to install the Gadgetron on a clean Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base (64-bit) machine.

As indicated in [[List of Dependencies]], the Gadgetron relies on multiple external libraries. Many of those libraries are not available as easy install packages and must be compiled separately. That is why we offer an option to download precompiled binaries of dependencies. 

If you are uncomfortable setting up development tools on Windows, or if you are just looking for a fast and easy way to get started with the Gadgetron, we recommend installing on Ubuntu Linux - possibly using a virtual machine inside Windows (see [[Linux Installation]])

## Installation instructions:

### Install required software: 

- Install Visual Studio 2013
