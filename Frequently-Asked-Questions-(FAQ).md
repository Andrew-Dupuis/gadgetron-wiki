-   *Can I make a branching Gadget chain?*

    The short answer is no. We plan on supporting this in a future release, but it is not quite ready yet.

-   *How can I help?*

    We are always looking for people who are interested in helping with the continuing development of the Gadgetron. There are many things you can do:

    -   Use it.

    -   When you develop new Gadgets or Toolboxes, please consider submitting them to us so that we can include them in the archive.

    -   Help us implement some of the future features in [Future Features]. It is probably a good idea to get in touch with us before you start coding, just in case somebody is already working on it.

-   *Who can help?*

    We are always committed to help Gadgetron users and developers. All comments, bug reports, user experiences are welcome!
