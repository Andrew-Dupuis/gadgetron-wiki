The Gadgetron is evolving continuously and there are many things still that we would like to include but have not yet had the time to do. This appendix serves as a to-do list of features to be implement as we go along.

-   Branching Gadget chains. There is currently no ability to branch and collect in the Gadgetron.
-   Persistent memory storage across Gadget chains.
-   Matlab Gadgets. It would be great to have a way to encapsulate Matlab code in a Gadget similar to the way that the Python Gadgets work.
-   Add Gadget4, Gadget5
-   Make it possible for a reader to access an arbitrary Gadget in the chain
-   Add Event_Handler to Reactor to deal with key strokes and SIGINT to ensure graceful shutdown
-   Logging server
-   Data display
-  A tool (web based) for monitoring and controlling a remote Gadgetron instance.
